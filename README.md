# Qt Tests

A simple Qt core application to explore Qt testing with the following components:
- Simple database class to query a database.
- Contains the simple functions that wrap around the following queries:
  - SELECT ALL
  - DELETE
  - INSERT
- A test class to test the database class functions.
- Unit tests.
- Functions to create test data.

The application is still a work in progress.
